# MNISTDigits_ImageRecognition

#### Background
The Big Data and Artificial Intelligence class I took in the spring semester was a huge learning curve for me. Since I primarily had a background in predictive analytics, learning about more complex machine learning algorithms was exciting ! As a final project for our BD and AI class we were asked to work on the Digits Recognition Dataset from MNIST and build a robust model that was fast, scalable and gave a good accuracy on the test dataset. We chose to run and explore the Neural Nets family of algorithms using Tensorflow and Keras and deep dived into the vairous ways we could imporve algorithm accuracy. Our final model achieved an accuracy of 99.48%.

#### My Learnings 
The most important observation we have realized is the tradeoff between the accuracy rate and the model runtime. It is to be expected that higher the epochs, 
higher the accuracy but we also kept in mind the runtime of the model. We had to find a balance between the two and achieve high accuracy while ensuring that the training time is quick and efficient. Another interesting thing that came out of this experience was the importance of increasing diversity amongst the training data, we generally always work on making the model architecture more resillient to better our accuracy, but in our experience, adding features such as rotating the images, zooming the images worked better to improve accuracies
